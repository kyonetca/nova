IMPORTANT:
Currently the software is in development. It is planned to release a 
full documentation later.

INFORMATION:
Nova is a massive cloud-computing networking software.
Cross-Plattform compability is supported:
	Linux (tested on openSUSE)
	Windows (Cygwin needed)

The Final Target is:
	With Nova it is possible to organize clients within groups.
	(similar to multicast)
	Clients don't need to know each other. They connect by themselfes
	over the internet. No master server is needed. The organisation
	of the clients work simply over datagrams between all clients in
	the network. (similar to internet routing protocols)

Encryption is included.

SOURCE CODE:
The Source Code is available via GitHub.
